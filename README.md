# OTP Work Board
#### An OpenSource Project to build a localized Opportunity site for people who live outside of the Atlanta perimeter

# How is it different???

OTP Work Board is a project designed to focus on individuals who are attempting to avoid the extensive commute into downtown Atlanta.  Many people have exceptional skills, however, they have made a decision to work, and live, away from the urban area.  They recognize that our profession is built on the same technology that enables people to order online from either Amazon, or Walmart. Our services don't require us to waste 1.5 hours driving each way.  That time can be spent working on projects for these employers.  However, we do recognize the importance of the face-to-face, so being within driving distance of the perimeter gives us an advantage over a truly remote employee.  So, this site is one that focuses on our unique skills and pairs us in a way that global boards simply ignore.

### This project was created out of a discussion at: [OTPDevs Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OTPdevs)
